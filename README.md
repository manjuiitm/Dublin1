# GitHub Users and Repositories in Dublin

This project collects GitHub users in Dublin with more than 50 followers and their repositories.

## Data Collection

- I scraped GitHub user data using the GitHub API, filtering for users in Dublin with over 50 followers, and collected their details and repositories into CSV files for analysis.

## Key Findings

- One surprising finding was that a significant percentage of users had diverse programming languages represented in their repositories, highlighting a rich developer community in Dublin.

## Recommendations

- Developers should consider collaborating across different languages and projects to leverage the diverse skill sets within the Dublin GitHub community, potentially leading to innovative solutions and partnerships.

## Files Included

- `users.csv`: Contains details of users in Dublin with over 50 followers.
- `repositories.csv`: Lists the public repositories associated with those users.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project.

## How to Run the Analysis

1. Ensure you have Python and the required libraries installed (`requests`, `pandas`).
2. Replace `YOUR_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN` in the script with your actual GitHub personal access token.
3. Execute the script to generate the CSV files and this README.
